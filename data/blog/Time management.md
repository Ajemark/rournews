## What is Time management?

Time management is the strategy of planning out your available time and controlling the amount of time you spend on specific tasks in order to work more efficiently.

Time management is essential in our daily activities. It makes one productive, efficient and effective. Most people don’t know how to manage their time effectively, they tend to fall victim to underachievement, difficulty getting organized, trouble getting started, trouble managing many simultaneous projects, and trouble with follow-through, missing deadlines, increasing stress levels, Running work-life balance, Harming professional reputation etc.


## How to create effective time management.

There strategies and principles to follow for effective time management, these includes :
-   **Get Organized:** when organizing your activities for the day you must apply what we call Triage- is a method adopted by the medical care for patience, when a patience case is severe than the other they attend to the patience with severe case, likewise in organizing your tasks or activities for the day put the tasks that require urgent attention.

-   **Protect Your Time:** After organizing your tasks the next thing is to protect your time. I know you must be asking how to protect your time, by applying these three things which are Insulation, Isolation, and Delegation. In our next article we will deliberate more on Insulation, Isolation, and Delegation.

-   **Focus On Your Goal:** Focus on the goals you have set for yourself or for your company, in achieving these goals you will set time and deadline for all your tasks and you will be motivated.

-   **Recovering From Bad Habits:** Procrastination is one of the biggest time eaters, you must get rid of procrastination. Most people fall into this bad habit and they are hooked up with tasks not done and it will make them inefficient, ineffective, and less productive. Time cannot control and so make use of it wisely.

-   **Time Of Tackling A Task:** As tasks requiring high levels of concentration and mental energy are often done at the beginning of the day when a person is more refreshed. This focuses on overcoming chronic psychological issues such as procrastination.

-   **Wake up early:** Starting your day early increases the amount of time you have for yourself. This means you get more time to complete daily tasks and to meet up with deadlines.

-   **Create a schedule and stick to it:** Creating a simple daily to-do list helps to keep all your plans and tasks in order. When you already have a set plan, you go about your day faster.

-   **Set realistic goals and prioritize from most to least important:** Setting goals can range from daily, weekly, monthly to yearly. You can make the most of your time by starting your tasks from the most important or urgent ones down to the least important
-   **Take small breaks in between tasks:** Taking small breaks in between tasks keeps you productive, it gives room for the brain to refresh and helps you stay energized to complete your tasks.

-   **Delegate unimportant tasks:** You don’t have to do it all whether you are a newbie, executive, or a manager. One of the best things about delegating is that it gives you enough time to focus on important things and reduces your workload a big time. No matter at which professional stage you are at this point in your life, it’s always a smart choice to learn how to delegate tasks to others and let other people share some load with you.

## HOW TO SET PRIORITIES AND GOALS

In setting your priorities and goals there are recommended Time Management strategies and I am going to show you here in this article, take a pen and write them down. You can use this strategy in setting both personal, business, job, career, and company task you may want to do. Perhaps one must work with;

-   "Work in Priority Order" – set goals and prioritize,
    
-   "Set gravitational goals" – that attract actions automatically
    

These goals are documented and may be broken down into a project, an action plan, or a simple task list. For individual tasks or for goals, an importance rating may be established, deadlines may be set, and priorities appointed. This process results in a plan with a task list, schedule, or calendar of activities. Authors may recommend a daily, weekly, monthly, or other planning periods, associated with different scope of planning or review. This is done in various ways, as follows:

## ABCD analysis

A technique that has been used in business management for a long time is the categorization of large data into groups. These groups are often marked A, B, C and D—hence the name. Activities are ranked by these general criteria:

-   **A** – Tasks that are discerned as being urgent and important,
    
-   **B** – Tasks that are important but not urgent,
    
-   **C** – Tasks that are unimportant but urgent,
    
-   **D** – Tasks that are unimportant and not urgent.
    

Each group is then rank-ordered by priority - to further clarify the prioritization, some individuals choose to then force-rank all "B" items as either "A" or "C". ABC analysis can incorporate more than three groups

ABC analysis is frequently combined with Pareto analysis

## Pareto analysis

The Pareto principle is the idea that 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes. Applied to productivity, it means that 80% of results can be achieved by doing 20% of tasks If productivity is the aim of time management, then these tasks should be prioritized higher.

## The Eisenhower Method

The "Eisenhower Method or "Eisenhower Principle" is a method that utilizes the principles of importance and urgency to organize priorities and workload. This method stems from a quote attributed to Dwight D. Eisenhower: "I have two kinds of problems, the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent." Eisenhower did not claim this insight for his own, but attributed it to an (unnamed) "former college president."

Using the Eisenhower Decision Principle, tasks are evaluated using the criteria important/unimportant and urgent/not urgent, and then placed in according quadrants in an Eisenhower Matrix (also known as an "Eisenhower Box" or "Eisenhower Decision Matrix"). Tasks in the quadrants are then handled as follows.

1.  Important/Urgent quadrant tasks are done immediately and personally, e.g. crises, deadlines, problems.
    
2.  Important/Not Urgent quadrant tasks get an end date and are done personally, e.g. relationships, planning, recreation/
    
3.  Unimportant/Urgent quadrant tasks are delegated, e.g. interruptions, meetings, activities.
    
4.  Unimportant/Not Urgent quadrant tasks are dropped, e.g. time wasters, pleasant activities, trivia.
    

### POSEC method

POSEC is an acronym for "Prioritize by Organizing, Streamlining, Economizing and Contributing". The method dictates a template which emphasizes an average individual's immediate sense of emotional and monetary security. It suggests that by attending to one's personal obligations first, an individual is better positioned to shoulder collective responsibilities.

Inherent in the acronym is a hierarchy of self-realization, which mirrors Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

1.  Prioritize your time and define your life by goals.
    
2.  Organize things you have to accomplish regularly to be successful (family and finances).
    
3.  Streamline things you may not like to do, but must do (work and chores).
    
4.  Economize things you should do or may even like to do, but they're not pressingly urgent (pastimes and socializing).
    
5.  Contribute by paying attention to the few remaining things that make a difference (social obligations).
    

After setting and prioritizing your goals it's then time to act earnestly on them and the way you act on them determines your time management productivity, efficiency, and effectiveness.
